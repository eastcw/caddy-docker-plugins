A repository for building docker images of Caddy server with customised plugins for personal use.

The plugins currently included are:

- [Cloudflare Trusted Proxy](https://github.com/WeidiDeng/caddy-cloudflare-ip)
- [Cloudflare DNS](https://github.com/caddy-dns/cloudflare)
- [Crowdsec](https://github.com/hslatman/caddy-crowdsec-bouncer/)
- [Rate Limiter](https://github.com/RussellLuo/caddy-ext/)

I reserve the right to change the plugins included or cease updating the repository without warning.

With thanks and credit to [Serfriz](https://github.com/serfriz/caddy-custom-builds) for the concept and workflow and automations.
